History of Holi
The Hindu religion believes there was a devil king named Hiranyakashyap long ago. 
He had a son named Prahlad and a sister called Holika. 
It is believed that the devil king had blessings of Lord Brahma. 
This blessing meant no man, animal or weapon could kill him. 
This blessing turned into a curse for him as he became very arrogant. 
He ordered his kingdom to worship him instead of God, not sparing his own son.

Following this, all the people began worshipping him except for his son, Prahlad. 
Prahlad refused to worship his father instead of God as he was a true believer of Lord Vishnu. 
Upon seeing his disobedience, the devil king planned with his sister to kill Prahlad. 
He made her sit in the fire with his son on the lap, where Holika got burned and Prahlad came out safe. 
This indicated he was protected by his Lord because of his devotion. 
Thus, people started celebrating Holi as the victory of good over evil.
